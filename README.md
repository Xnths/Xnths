- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xnths
- 👀 I’m interested in solving everyday problems with smart solutions. In addition, I love to have an organized code, which I commit some time working on it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning back-end programming, game development and front-end.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on back-end systems.
- 📫 If you want to discuss a little bit with me, please reach me out on jonathascastilhoes@gmail.com

Looking forward to become a developer on technologies like Java, JavaScript, MySQL, C# or NodeJS.
